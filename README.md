Data science techniques are essential for analyzing job markets, yet many existing methods rely on large labeled datasets and are tailored to the US context. To address these limitations, this paper presents a two-stage job title identification methodology designed for smaller datasets. In the first stage, BERT is used to classify job ads by sector (e.g., IT or Agriculture), followed by unsupervised algorithms and similarity measures to identify the most relevant job title within the predicted sector. A novel document embedding strategy further enhances classification by incorporating weighting and noise reduction techniques. Experimental results show that this Big Data Job Analysis method improves accuracy by over 14% in some sectors and boosts performance by 23.5% compared to traditional Bag of Words models. Applied to Moroccan job data, the approach reveals valuable insights into emerging occupations and demonstrates its broader applicability beyond the US.
